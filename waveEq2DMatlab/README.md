# waveEq2DMatlab
This repository contains some examples of solving 2D wave equations with interfaces (jump discontinuities in model parameters) present.
I'm in the process of making it more public-friendly.

## Update 1 (December 15, 2018)

So, it's been a long time since I've been around this repo! But I haven't totally lost sight of my cleanup goals here. I've started today by renaming (and rereferencing) the functions and scripts herein to make them more user-friendly. Cleanup of the actual logic will happen soon.
